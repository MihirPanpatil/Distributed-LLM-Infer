Below is a detailed overview of DeepSpeed along with guidance on how to run it in a distributed setup over a local network.

What is DeepSpeed?
DeepSpeed is an open‐source deep learning optimization library developed by Microsoft Research for PyTorch. It’s designed to overcome the memory and compute challenges of training very large models (ranging from billions to over a trillion parameters) on existing hardware. Its key goals are:
Memory efficiency: DeepSpeed’s innovative optimizations—especially its Zero Redundancy Optimizer (ZeRO)—dramatically reduce the memory footprint of large models.


High throughput and scalability: By combining different forms of parallelism (data, model, and pipeline parallelism, sometimes referred to as 3D parallelism), DeepSpeed helps you efficiently scale training across many GPUs and nodes.


Ease of integration: It acts as a lightweight wrapper for PyTorch so that only a few code changes are needed to leverage its features.

Core Features of DeepSpeed
Zero Redundancy Optimizer (ZeRO):
 DeepSpeed introduces several ZeRO stages:


ZeRO Stage 1: Partitions the optimizer states across GPUs while replicating model parameters and gradients.


ZeRO Stage 2: Additionally shards gradients across GPUs.


ZeRO Stage 3: Partitions model parameters as well—enabling training of models that are far larger than the memory of any individual GPU.


These techniques allow DeepSpeed to dramatically reduce memory redundancy, meaning you can train larger models on the same hardware.


3D Parallelism:
 DeepSpeed enables a hybrid approach by combining:


Data Parallelism: Each GPU processes a subset of the input batch.


Model Parallelism: Splits the model’s layers or tensors across GPUs.


Pipeline Parallelism: Divides the model into stages that can process different micro-batches concurrently.


This 3D strategy balances memory usage and compute, making it possible to scale out to very large models.


Mixed Precision Training:
 By using FP16 or BF16, DeepSpeed reduces the memory footprint and speeds up training, while still preserving model accuracy.


Additional Optimizations:
 Other features include gradient checkpointing (to trade computation for memory savings), sparse attention kernels (to efficiently handle long sequence inputs), and support for CPU and NVMe offloading (via ZeRO-Offload and ZeRO-Infinity) to further extend model capacity.

How Does DeepSpeed Work?
DeepSpeed wraps your standard PyTorch model and optimizer to insert its advanced distributed and memory optimization techniques. In a typical workflow, you:
Initialize DeepSpeed:
 Replace your regular optimizer initialization with a DeepSpeed initializer. This call automatically sets up the distributed environment (using NCCL by default) and wraps your model.


Training Loop:
 Use DeepSpeed’s API for forward passes, backward passes, and optimization steps:

 for step, batch in enumerate(data_loader):
    loss = model_engine(batch)      # Forward pass using DeepSpeed-wrapped model
    model_engine.backward(loss)       # Backward pass
    model_engine.step()               # Parameter update


Checkpointing:
 DeepSpeed provides built-in methods to save and load checkpoints that store both model and optimizer states.

Running DeepSpeed on a Distributed Local Network
DeepSpeed supports distributed training across multiple nodes (computers) on a local network. Here’s how to set it up:
1. Prepare Your Environment
Ensure Consistent Software:
 Install DeepSpeed and its dependencies on all machines in your network. Typically, you’d install it via pip:

 pip install deepspeed


Configure Passwordless SSH:
 For multi-node setups, it’s common to set up passwordless SSH so that nodes can communicate seamlessly.


Synchronize Clocks & Environment Variables:
 Make sure that all nodes have synchronized clocks and proper CUDA, NCCL, and PyTorch configurations.


2. Create a Hostfile
A hostfile is a simple text file that lists the available nodes and the number of GPU “slots” on each node. For example:
node1 slots=4
node2 slots=4

This tells DeepSpeed that “node1” and “node2” each have 4 GPUs available.
3. Launching Distributed Training
Use the DeepSpeed launcher with your hostfile to start the distributed training job. An example command might be:
deepspeed --hostfile=hostfile.txt \
          my_training_script.py \
          --deepspeed --deepspeed_config ds_config.json

Explanation:


--hostfile=hostfile.txt tells DeepSpeed which nodes to use.


my_training_script.py is your Python training script that has been integrated with DeepSpeed.


--deepspeed_config ds_config.json points to your DeepSpeed configuration file which specifies settings such as ZeRO stage, batch sizes, mixed precision, etc.


citeturn0search4
4. Consider Network Bandwidth
For optimal performance, especially when sharding model parameters across nodes (as with ZeRO Stage 3), ensure your network interconnect (e.g., Ethernet, InfiniBand) is sufficiently fast. In local networks, even gigabit Ethernet can work for modest models, though higher bandwidth (e.g., 10GbE or better) is recommended for larger models.

Example: Putting It All Together
Below is a simplified example of a DeepSpeed training script designed for a distributed local network:
import torch
import deepspeed
from torch import nn

# Define a simple model
class SimpleModel(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super(SimpleModel, self).__init__()
        self.fc = nn.Linear(1024, 10)

    def forward(self, x):
        return self.fc(x)

# Instantiate model and dummy data
model = SimpleModel()
dummy_input = torch.randn(32, 1024)  # example batch

# DeepSpeed configuration file (ds_config.json) should be prepared with desired settings
# For example, enabling ZeRO Stage 2:
# {
#    "train_batch_size": 32,
#    "gradient_accumulation_steps": 1,
#    "optimizer": {"type": "AdamW", "params": {"lr": 0.001}},
#    "fp16": {"enabled": true},
#    "zero_optimization": {"stage": 2}
# }

# Initialize DeepSpeed
model_engine, optimizer, _, _ = deepspeed.initialize(
    args=None,
    model=model,
    model_parameters=model.parameters(),
    config="ds_config.json"
)

# Training loop
for epoch in range(10):
    output = model_engine(dummy_input)
    loss = output.mean()  # dummy loss
    model_engine.backward(loss)
    model_engine.step()

To run this script on two machines (each with 4 GPUs) in your local network, you would:
Create a hostfile (e.g., hostfile.txt) with:

 node1 slots=4
node2 slots=4


Execute:

 deepspeed --hostfile=hostfile.txt my_training_script.py --deepspeed --deepspeed_config ds_config.json


This command will distribute the training across all 8 GPUs on the two nodes.

Conclusion
DeepSpeed provides a comprehensive suite of tools for training extremely large models efficiently. By integrating advanced techniques like ZeRO (in various stages), 3D parallelism, and mixed precision, it reduces memory requirements and increases training throughput. Running DeepSpeed over a distributed local network is straightforward using a hostfile and the DeepSpeed launcher, making it accessible even when scaling out across multiple computers.
Feel free to ask if you need further clarification or additional examples!

















Below is an in‐depth guide on how to run popular large language models – such as LLaMA, Mistral, Falcon, OPT, BLOOM, GPT‑NeoX, Qwen, and Gemma – using DeepSpeed on your system. This guide covers everything from installing the prerequisites to launching a distributed training or inference job.

1. Prerequisites and Environment Setup
Hardware & Software Requirements
GPU(s): A system with one or more NVIDIA GPUs (e.g., A100, V100, or RTX series) is highly recommended. For distributed training, you can use multiple GPUs across several nodes.


Operating System: Linux (Ubuntu is common) or any OS where PyTorch and CUDA are supported.


CUDA and NCCL: Ensure you have the correct CUDA version installed and that your GPUs can communicate via NCCL. For multi-node setups, verify that your network interconnect (e.g., Ethernet or InfiniBand) meets the bandwidth requirements.


Python Environment: Python 3.8+ is recommended.


Software Installation
Install PyTorch:
 Follow the instructions on PyTorch’s website to install a version compatible with your CUDA version.


Install DeepSpeed:
 DeepSpeed is available via pip. Install it with:

 pip install deepspeed
 This installs DeepSpeed along with its dependencies, including CUDA extensions for optimal performance.
 citeturn0search19


Install Hugging Face Transformers (optional but recommended):
 Since most of these models are available via Hugging Face, install their Transformers library:

 pip install transformers
 This allows you to load models like LLaMA, Falcon, BLOOM, etc., directly from the Hugging Face Model Hub.
 citeturn0search10



2. Downloading and Loading the Model
For each model family, the steps are similar. For example, to load a LLaMA or Falcon model:
Choose the appropriate model repository:


LLaMA: Use repositories such as decapoda-research/llama-7b-hf.


Mistral: Models like mistralai/Mistral-7B-v0.1.


Falcon: For instance, tiiuae/falcon-7b.


OPT: Example: facebook/opt-6.7b.


BLOOM: Example: bigscience/bloom-560m or larger variants.


GPT‑NeoX: Such as EleutherAI/gpt-neox-20b.


Qwen and Gemma: Follow the corresponding model cards on Hugging Face.


Loading the model in your script:
 Use the Hugging Face Transformers API to load the model and tokenizer. For example:

 from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer

model_name = "tiiuae/falcon-7b"  # Replace with your model of choice
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)
model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(model_name, device_map="auto")
 The device_map="auto" argument helps to load the model on available GPUs if you are running on a single machine. For distributed training, DeepSpeed will handle device placement.
 citeturn0search10



3. Integrating DeepSpeed with Your Model
DeepSpeed wraps your model and optimizer to enable memory optimizations (via ZeRO), mixed precision, and distributed training. Here’s how to modify your training/inference script:
Sample Training Script
import torch
import deepspeed
from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer

# Load your model and tokenizer (e.g., Falcon, LLaMA, BLOOM, etc.)
model_name = "tiiuae/falcon-7b"  # Change this to your chosen model
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)
model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(model_name, device_map="auto")

# Create a dummy dataset or use your actual dataset
dummy_input = tokenizer("DeepSpeed is amazing!", return_tensors="pt").input_ids

# DeepSpeed configuration is provided via a JSON file (see next section)
ds_config = "ds_config.json"

# Initialize DeepSpeed (it sets up distributed training, mixed precision, ZeRO optimizations, etc.)
model_engine, optimizer, _, _ = deepspeed.initialize(
    model=model,
    model_parameters=model.parameters(),
    config=ds_config
)

# Training loop example
for epoch in range(3):
    outputs = model_engine(dummy_input.to(model_engine.local_rank))
    loss = outputs.logits.mean()  # This is a placeholder; use your actual loss function
    model_engine.backward(loss)
    model_engine.step()

In this script:
deepspeed.initialize wraps your model and optimizer, applying optimizations (such as ZeRO stage settings) specified in the configuration file.


The training loop uses DeepSpeed’s API for backward propagation and optimizer steps.
 citeturn0search0



4. Creating a DeepSpeed Configuration File
A DeepSpeed JSON configuration file (ds_config.json) controls the optimizations and training settings. Here’s an example configuration optimized for training a large transformer model:
{
  "train_batch_size": 32,
  "gradient_accumulation_steps": 1,
  "optimizer": {
    "type": "AdamW",
    "params": {
      "lr": 0.00015,
      "weight_decay": 0.01
    }
  },
  "fp16": {
    "enabled": true,
    "loss_scale": 0,
    "loss_scale_window": 1000,
    "hysteresis": 2,
    "min_loss_scale": 1
  },
  "zero_optimization": {
    "stage": 2,  // Use stage 2 or stage 3 depending on your GPU memory availability
    "allgather_partitions": true,
    "overlap_comm": true,
    "reduce_scatter": true
  }
}

Key Points:
ZeRO Stage: For extremely large models (e.g., GPT‑NeoX, BLOOM, or Qwen), you might choose ZeRO Stage 3 if your system has enough GPUs and you want to shard model parameters. For moderate-sized models (like Falcon-7B or LLaMA-7B), Stage 2 may be sufficient.


Mixed Precision (FP16/BF16): Enabled to reduce memory usage and speed up computation.


Optimizer Settings: Adjust the learning rate and weight decay based on your model and dataset.

5. Launching Training/Inference on Your System
Single-Node Execution
If you are running on a single machine with multiple GPUs, you can start training with:
deepspeed --num_gpus=4 train_script.py --deepspeed --deepspeed_config ds_config.json

This command tells DeepSpeed to use 4 GPUs available on your system.
Distributed Multi-Node Execution
For a local network (multiple computers), perform the following steps:
Create a Hostfile:
 A hostfile (e.g., hostfile.txt) lists your nodes and the number of GPUs available on each:

 node1 slots=4
node2 slots=4


Launch Distributed Training:
 Use the DeepSpeed launcher:

 deepspeed --hostfile=hostfile.txt train_script.py --deepspeed --deepspeed_config ds_config.json
 DeepSpeed will use the hostfile to allocate processes across the listed nodes.


citeturn0search4
Inference Mode
For inference, DeepSpeed provides an optimized inference engine that can handle even larger models by sharding parameters across GPUs. In your inference script:
Wrap your model with DeepSpeed’s inference API.


Use a corresponding DeepSpeed Inference configuration (often with ZeRO Stage 3).


For example:
import deepspeed
from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer

model_name = "bigscience/bloom-560m"  # Example for BLOOM; change as needed
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)
model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(model_name)

# Initialize inference with DeepSpeed Inference API
ds_inference_config = "ds_inference_config.json"  # Inference config file with ZeRO Stage 3 options

model_engine = deepspeed.init_inference(
    model,
    config=ds_inference_config,
    mp_size=1  # or set model parallelism size if needed
)

# Run inference
input_text = "DeepSpeed makes large model inference efficient."
input_ids = tokenizer(input_text, return_tensors="pt").input_ids.to(model_engine.module.device)
outputs = model_engine.module.generate(input_ids)
print(tokenizer.decode(outputs[0], skip_special_tokens=True))

citeturn0search3

6. Special Considerations for Different Models
While the overall workflow remains the same, here are some model-specific pointers:
LLaMA & Mistral:
 These models are available on Hugging Face in HF-compatible formats. Due to their architecture, you might want to check if any model-specific tweaks (like attention mask handling) are needed.


Falcon & OPT:
 Both are causal language models; ensure you set the correct tokenizer parameters and possibly use DeepSpeed Inference for faster generation.


BLOOM:
 BLOOM models are multilingual and can be very large. You may need to opt for ZeRO Stage 3 or even ZeRO-Offload if GPU memory is a bottleneck.


GPT-NeoX:
 Typically, these models have been trained using extensive model parallelism. When fine-tuning or running inference, using DeepSpeed with ZeRO Stage 3 can help you fit the model across GPUs.


Qwen & Gemma:
 Newer models may have their own nuances; always refer to their model cards for any specific instructions. However, the general DeepSpeed integration remains similar.


citeturn0search10

Conclusion
By following these steps, you can execute training and inference for large models like LLaMA, Mistral, Falcon, OPT, BLOOM, GPT-NeoX, Qwen, and Gemma on your system. The process involves:
Setting up your environment (installing PyTorch, DeepSpeed, and Transformers),


Loading the model via Hugging Face,


Integrating DeepSpeed using its initialization API and a configuration file (tailored to your available hardware and the model’s requirements),


Launching the job using DeepSpeed’s command-line launcher for either single-node or multi-node distributed setups.


This approach lets you take full advantage of DeepSpeed’s memory and computational optimizations—enabling efficient training and inference even for extremely large transformer models.
Feel free to ask further questions if you need additional clarifications or tips for specific setups!




To distribute training over multiple computers on a local network using DeepSpeed, you need to set up a multi-node environment where each machine (node) contributes its GPUs to a single distributed training job. Here’s a step‐by‐step guide:

1. Environment Preparation
Software Installation on All Nodes:


Python & PyTorch: Ensure all nodes have a compatible version of Python and PyTorch installed.


DeepSpeed: Install DeepSpeed on every machine:

 pip install deepspeed


Hugging Face Transformers (if needed):

 pip install transformers


Network & System Configuration:


Passwordless SSH: Set up passwordless SSH between all nodes so that they can communicate without manual login. This typically involves generating an SSH key on each node and copying the public key to all other nodes.


Synchronized Clocks: Make sure all nodes have synchronized system clocks.


NCCL Settings: Verify that your network interconnect is set up correctly (e.g., proper settings for NCCL such as NCCL_DEBUG=INFO can help diagnose communication issues).



2. Create a Hostfile
A hostfile is a text file that lists the hostnames or IP addresses of all nodes and specifies the number of available GPU “slots” on each. For example, if you have two nodes with 4 GPUs each, your hostfile (hostfile.txt) might look like this:
node1 slots=4
node2 slots=4

If you prefer using IP addresses, it might be:
192.168.1.100 slots=4
192.168.1.101 slots=4

This file tells DeepSpeed how many GPU processes to launch on each node.

3. Configure DeepSpeed in Your Training Script
Your training script should integrate DeepSpeed to wrap your model and optimizer. For example:
import torch
import deepspeed
from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer

# Load your model and tokenizer (e.g., Falcon, LLaMA, BLOOM, etc.)
model_name = "tiiuae/falcon-7b"  # replace with your model of choice
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)
model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(model_name, device_map="auto")

# Create a dummy input or load your dataset
dummy_input = tokenizer("DeepSpeed distributed training", return_tensors="pt").input_ids

# Specify the path to your DeepSpeed config JSON file
ds_config = "ds_config.json"

# Initialize DeepSpeed
model_engine, optimizer, _, _ = deepspeed.initialize(
    model=model,
    model_parameters=model.parameters(),
    config=ds_config
)

# Example training loop
for epoch in range(3):
    outputs = model_engine(dummy_input.to(model_engine.local_rank))
    loss = outputs.logits.mean()  # Use your actual loss computation here
    model_engine.backward(loss)
    model_engine.step()

Your DeepSpeed config file (e.g., ds_config.json) might include settings such as ZeRO optimization stage, mixed precision, etc.

4. Launch the Distributed Job
With your hostfile and training script ready, launch the distributed training job using DeepSpeed’s launcher. From the command line on the master node (or from any node that can access the hostfile), run:
deepspeed --hostfile=hostfile.txt train_script.py --deepspeed --deepspeed_config ds_config.json

--hostfile=hostfile.txt tells DeepSpeed to distribute the job across the nodes listed in the file.


train_script.py is your training script.


--deepspeed_config ds_config.json points to your DeepSpeed configuration file.


DeepSpeed will automatically start the appropriate number of processes on each node based on the slots specified.

5. Additional Considerations
Network Bandwidth:
 Ensure that your local network provides sufficient bandwidth for inter-node communication. DeepSpeed relies on collective operations (like all-reduce) to synchronize gradients, so higher bandwidth (e.g., 10GbE or InfiniBand) will improve performance.


Environment Variables:
 It’s often helpful to set environment variables such as:

 export NCCL_DEBUG=INFO
export TORCH_DISTRIBUTED_DEBUG=INFO
 These can help in troubleshooting communication issues.


No-SSH Mode (if necessary):
 If setting up passwordless SSH is not feasible, DeepSpeed also supports a “no_ssh” mode. In this case, you launch the training command separately on each node, providing the node rank, master address, and port:

 deepspeed --hostfile=hostfile.txt --no_ssh --node_rank=<n> --master_addr=<MASTER_IP> --master_port=<PORT> train_script.py --deepspeed --deepspeed_config ds_config.json

Summary
To run DeepSpeed distributed training over multiple computers on a local network:
Prepare the environment on all nodes (install DeepSpeed, PyTorch, set up passwordless SSH, and synchronize system clocks).


Create a hostfile listing each node and the available GPU slots.


Integrate DeepSpeed into your training script to wrap your model, optimizer, and training loop.


Launch the job using the DeepSpeed launcher with the hostfile and configuration file.


Following these steps, you can efficiently distribute the training of large language models (like LLaMA, Mistral, Falcon, OPT, BLOOM, GPT-NeoX, Qwen, and Gemma) over multiple computers on your local network.
Feel free to ask if you have any further questions or need additional assistance with specific configurations!



If you’re not entirely sure how many GPUs are available on the network, there are several approaches you can take to determine or work around this uncertainty:

1. Querying Each Node
Manual Check:
 You can log into each machine and run commands like:

 nvidia-smi --query-gpu=name --format=csv,noheader | wc -l
 or, within Python:

 import torch
print(torch.cuda.device_count())
 This will tell you the number of GPUs on that node.


Automated Script:
 Write a small script that runs on each node and reports the GPU count back to a central location. This is especially useful in larger networks.



2. Using Cluster or Scheduler Environment Variables
Cluster Managers:
 If you’re using a resource manager or cluster scheduler (e.g., Slurm), it often sets environment variables (like SLURM_GPUS_ON_NODE or similar) that can be queried. DeepSpeed can sometimes use these environment variables automatically.


Auto-Discovery (Single-Node Default):
 If no hostfile is provided, DeepSpeed defaults to querying the local machine’s GPU count. However, for a multi-node environment, you typically need to provide a hostfile or specify the number of nodes and GPUs explicitly.



3. Building a Hostfile Dynamically
Dynamic Hostfile Generation:
 If you’re unsure about the number of GPUs on each node, you can develop a script that automatically queries each node (using SSH, for instance) and builds a hostfile listing the available GPUs. For example:

 # pseudo-code
for node in list_of_nodes:
    gpu_count=$(ssh $node "nvidia-smi --query-gpu=name --format=csv,noheader | wc -l")
    echo "$node slots=$gpu_count" >> hostfile.txt
 This script helps you build an accurate hostfile for your network.



4. Using DeepSpeed’s Default Behavior
Single-Node Fallback:
 If you launch a DeepSpeed job without a hostfile in a multi-GPU environment, DeepSpeed will use all GPUs on the local machine. For multi-node scenarios, however, you must provide the node details so DeepSpeed can properly distribute the job.



By combining these methods, you can either directly determine the number of GPUs or build a configuration that dynamically adapts to the available hardware. This ensures that your DeepSpeed distributed training setup accurately reflects your network’s resources.
